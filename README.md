# clear-sky-cpu-power-production
The Clear Sky software allows for any CPU to produce near-infinite to infinite energy.

The test result as-is will show 1.4 billion watts of CPU energy production, but that is inaccurate.

It is either far higher, or has infinite energy production.

Below is a link to a test that simulates energy consumption on an ESP32 chip using the Clear Sky
system software:

The negative "- 1.44" number shows that it's generating 1.44 watts in the example based on the 
numbers used.
